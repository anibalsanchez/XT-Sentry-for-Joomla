# XT Sentry for Joomla

Open-source error tracking for Joomla. An implementation of the [Sentry Client](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) library for Joomla.

## Installation and configuration of Sentry

To start with the configuration, first, create a new project in Sentry and find the DSN. The URI has this format: https://24...9d@sentry.io/...s.

- Download and install this library. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/anibalsanchez/XT-Sentry-for-Joomla/releases).
- Create a script (sentry.php) to initialize the client and copy it to the Joomla **/cli folder**. This is a sample client initialization:

```php
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__).'/libraries/xtsentry/vendor/autoload.php';
\Sentry\init(['dsn' => 'YOUR-DSN', 'environment' => 'development']);

```

Finally, add the **cli/sentry.php** script to the PHP initialization following one of these methods.

- **php auto_prepend**, added as auto_prepare to PHP Selector -> Options: auto_prepend_file and set the full path
- **.user.ini** php auto prepend add:

```
auto_prepend_file="/home/.../public_html/cli/sentry.php"
```

- **.php ini** using the same auto_prepend_file .htaccess :

```
php_value auto_prepend_file /home/.../public_html/cli/sentry.php
```

- **index.php** - include it into the first line of the Joomla! Instance (index.php). However only works for the frontend instance Joomla! no other scripts are covered.

```
require_once '/home/.../public_html/cli/sentry.php';
```
